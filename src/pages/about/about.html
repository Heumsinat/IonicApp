Descriptive paragraphs include details that appeal to the five senses: sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing. In a descriptive paragraph, the writer must convey information that appeals to all the senses in order to give the best possible description to the reader. Descriptive paragraphs are commonly used in fiction and non-fiction writing to help immerse readers into the world of the author. Though there are no hard and fast rules for how exactly these paragraphs should be structured, there are several suggestions that can help you write an effective and appealing descriptive paragraph. See Step 1 to get started!
